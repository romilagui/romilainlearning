        <p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&#8217;ve got to focus on. But that&#8217;s not what it means at all.
            It means sayung no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.
            I&#8217;m actually as proud of the things we have&#8217;t done as the nthings I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
